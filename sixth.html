The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History is a 2014 non-fiction book by Elizabeth Kolbert that explores the ongoing mass extinction event caused by human activity. It won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 2015 and has been widely praised for its compelling storytelling and scientific depth.
Kolbert argues that Earth is currently experiencing its sixth mass extinction, comparable to past events like the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, this time, the primary cause is human activity—through climate change, habitat destruction, ocean acidification, and the spread of invasive species.

The book is structured around case studies of species that have gone extinct or are critically endangered due to human influence. Some key examples include:
<br>
<br>
The Golden Frog (Panama) – Wiped out in the wild by a fungal disease spread by global trade.
<br>
The Great Auk – A flightless bird hunted to extinction by the 19th century.
<br>
Coral Reefs – Threatened by ocean acidification caused by rising CO₂ levels.
<br>
Neanderthals – Possibly driven to extinction by competition with Homo sapiens.
<br>
<br>
Kolbert weaves together scientific research, history, and field reporting, traveling around the world to interview biologists, paleontologists, and conservationists.

The Sixth Extinction has been praised for making complex scientific concepts accessible to a broad audience. It raises urgent ethical questions about humanity’s role in shaping the planet’s future. Some critics argue that the book is pessimistic, but Kolbert presents the evidence compellingly, emphasizing that human-driven extinction is happening at an unprecedented rate.
