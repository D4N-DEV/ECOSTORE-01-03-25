"Ice Watch" is an art installation by Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson and geologist Minik Rosing. It features large blocks of glacial ice harvested from the waters around Greenland and placed in public spaces to visually and physically confront people with the reality of climate change.


The installation aims to create a direct, sensory experience of climate change. Instead of statistics or abstract warnings, "Ice Watch" brings melting ice into urban environments, allowing people to touch, see, and hear it as it slowly disappears. This tangible experience makes climate change more immediate and personal.

"Ice Watch" has been praised for making climate change visceral and accessible. However, some critics question the carbon footprint of transporting the ice. Despite this, Eliasson and Rosing argue that the awareness it generates far outweighs its environmental impact.
